Get the data: The data will be automatically downloaded via 'lib/datasets/mnist.py', you do not need to do it yourself
First Train the Fine Grained Forest:
Run python tools/train_fg.py --model models/mnist/gcforest/fg-tree500-depth100-3folds.json --log_dir logs/gcforest/mnist/fg --save_outputs
This means:
Train a fine grained model for MNIST dataset,
Using the structure defined in models/mnist/gcforest/fg-tree500-depth100-3folds.json
save the log files in logs/gcforest/mnist/fg
The output for the fine grained scanning predictions is saved in train.data_cache.cache_dir
Then, train the cascade forest (Note: make sure you run the train_fg.py first)
run python tools/train_cascade.py --model models/mnist/gcforest/fg-tree500-depth100-3folds-ca.json
This means:
Train the fine grained scaning results with cascade structure.
The cascade model specification is defined in 'models/mnist/gcforest/fg-tree500-depth100-3folds-ca.json'
